## 9. Teacher Class Selection Login

### Problem Solved

- System validates teacher access to selected class

### Login Flow

   - System loads all available classes
   - Teacher selects class from dropdown showing: "ClassCode - Course Year-Semester (University)"

   - Shows selected class information
   - Teacher enters username and password
   - System validates credentials for selected class
   - Redirects to dashboard for chosen class

### Backend Changes Required
```javascript
// GET /api/classes/all - Returns all classes for selection
// POST /api/auth/login - Modified to accept classId parameter

{
  username: "teacher_username",
  password: "teacher_password", 
  classId: "selected_class_id"
}
```
