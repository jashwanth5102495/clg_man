# Student Management System - Reverted to Simple Version

## Overview
This project has been reverted to its previous simple state, removing all the complex database integrations, authentication systems, and advanced features that were causing issues.

## What Was Removed
- MongoDB database integration
- Complex authentication with JWT tokens
- CSV file upload functionality
- Advanced student management features
- Complex backend routes and models
- Heavy dependencies (axios, mongoose, bcrypt, etc.)

## Current Simple Structure

### Frontend
- **App.tsx**: Simple routing with minimal components
- **ThemeContext.tsx**: Basic theme switching functionality
- **Dependencies**: Only React, React-DOM, and React-Router-DOM

### Backend
- **server.js**: Simple Express server with in-memory storage
- **Dependencies**: Only Express and CORS
- **No Database**: Uses simple arrays for data storage
- **No Authentication**: Demo endpoints that accept any credentials

## How to Run

### Frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

## Features Available
- Simple landing page with portal links
- Basic Teacher, Student, and Admin portal pages
- Simple backend API endpoints for demo purposes
- No complex functionality - just basic navigation

## Why This Reversion?
The previous complex implementation had multiple issues:
- Database connection problems
- Authentication failures
- White screen errors
- Complex dependencies causing conflicts
- Over-engineered for the requirements

This simple version provides a stable foundation that can be built upon incrementally without the complexity issues.

## Next Steps
If you want to add features back:
1. Start with one simple feature at a time
2. Test thoroughly before adding the next feature
3. Keep dependencies minimal
4. Avoid complex database operations initially
5. Use localStorage for simple data persistence first

This version should work reliably without any of the previous issues.
